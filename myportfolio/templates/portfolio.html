            About Me <br>

            I am a computer science student and an aspiring software engineer with a passion for AI, ethical hacking, and full-stack development. With hands-on experience in Flutter, Django, and C# (WPF & Windows Forms), I specialize in building real-time tracking systems, AI-driven applications, and cloud-integrated platforms.
            
            I have worked on projects that include:
            
            Vehicle & Person Tracking App – Uses real-time location tracking, AI-powered diagnostics, and Firebase.
            Doctor Scheduling System – A Django and Firebase-based appointment booking platform.
            Room Booking App – Helps users find vacant rooms based on location, price, security, and owner details.
            Alexander Transducer – A research project aimed at harnessing energy from noise, vibrations, and chaotic movements.
            Beyond software development, I am exploring cybersecurity and penetration testing to enhance system security. I am currently preparing for my industrial attachment in March and seeking opportunities to grow in a software-focused environment.
